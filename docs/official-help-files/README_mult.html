<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>This tutorial shows how to use the Tcl Dev Kit Debugger with profiling
to analyze the efficiency of your code. When the "Profiling" option is
selected in the
<a class="doc" href="Debugger.html#ChangeProCoverage">Project Settings</a>, the
Tcl Dev Kit Debugger will generate additional data about the time required to
execute individual commands. The sample projects use integer multiplication as
implemented in Tcl. While you would probably never implement multiplication in
a scripting language, this example demonstrates how the choice of algorithm 
affects the performance of an operation.</P>

<H2><A NAME="one">Step One: Open the Tutorial Program</A></H2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UNIX</strong>: Change to the directory 
  <CODE>/demos/TclDevKit/TclDebugger/Profiling/</CODE> beneath the root Tcl Dev Kit 
  installation directory, and run:
  
  <pre>tcldebugger mult_1.tpj</PRE></li>
  
  <li><strong>Windows</strong>: Click <STRONG>Start | Programs | ActiveState
  Tcl Dev Kit | Tcl Dev Kit Demos | Profiling and Coverage | Hotspot
  Multiplication I</STRONG></li>
</ul>

  
<P>The Tcl Dev Kit Debugger will open and load the <CODE>mult_1</CODE>
project. The file <CODE>mult_1_run.tcl</CODE> will open in the Code display
portion of the debugger's main window.</P>


<H2><A NAME="two">Step Two: View Unexecuted Lines</A></H2>

<P>Run the application in the debugger as usual. You can watch variables,
use the eval console, and perform all other debugging tasks while 
coverage information is being gathered in the background.</P>

<P>As the debugger executes lines in the application, lines that have 
not been executed will be displayed with a yellow background.</P>

<P>When the script has finished running, select <STRONG>View | Code Coverage</STRONG>,
or click the <strong>Coverage</strong> <img src="images/debug_cover_butt.gif"> 
button on the toolbar. The 
<STRONG>Code Coverage and Profiling</STRONG> dialog will be displayed.</P>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_mult_1.gif">


<H2><A NAME="three">Step Three: View Executed Lines</A></H2>

<P>Use the radio buttons at the top of the dialog to switch between
the highlighting modes. In Step Two, we discussed highlighting 
uncovered code. In this step, we'll look at highlighting covered code.</P>

<P>To view qualitative profiling information, select <STRONG>Highlight Covered 
Code for Selected File</STRONG>. Now, executed commands are colored in orange 
and black. The darker the color, the greater the number of times the command
was executed.</P>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_mult_2.gif">

<P>Notice that lines 13 and 14 have a black background. These 
lines have been executed the most often. These two lines make up
the main loop of the multiplication command and, together, are the
"hotspot" - that is, the part of the application that must be optimized 
to improve performance.</P>

<H2><A NAME="four">Step Four: Use the Coverage and Profiling Dialog</A></H2>

<P>A complex application might have several hotspots scattered over
multiple files, making this type of visual inspection
tedious. To make this easy, in the Code Coverage and Profiling dialog, 
select the <STRONG>Calls</STRONG> tab. (The default tab, <STRONG>Files</STRONG>, 
shows a list of files for which profiling information was collected.)</P>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_mult_3.gif">

<P>The <STRONG>Calls</STRONG> tab displays a list of all the lines in the program
that have been executed. The list contains the line number, the file
in which the line is located, and the number of calls made to the 
line. In addition, the Calls tab displays the minimum, average, maximum, and total
time spent to execute a particular command. Times are shown in microseconds.
By default, the list is sorted by the number of calls, so that 
the most frequently executed lines are displayed at the top.</P>

<P>If you were working with a large file, you could click on a line 
in the list and then click the <STRONG>Show Code</STRONG> button to position 
the code display in the debugger to the selected file and line.</P>
<P>In our example, we see that the commands on lines 13 and 14 were called a
whopping 15007 times, and used 212,705 and 229,367 microseconds of
processing time, respectively.</P>



<H2><A NAME="five">Step Five: An Improved Algorithm</A></H2>

<P>Think about the algorithms used in the hotspots that were
highlighted by the debugger in the previous step. In the 
real world, you might think about moving this part from 
a Tcl implementation to one based upon C. However, it 
is also possible to use a different algorithm to make 
the calculation more efficient.</P>

<P>The second tutorial project contains a program that rewrites 
the multiplication loop to use a halving/doubling
algorithm, instead of linearly incrementing the result.</P>

<P>Select <STRONG>File | Close Project</STRONG> to close the first project, 
then select <strong>File | Open Project</strong> to load the <CODE>mult_2.tpj</CODE>
project. The <CODE>mult_2_run.tcl</CODE> file will open in the Code display
portion of the debugger's main window.</P>

<P>Run the program to the end, then open the Code Coverage 
and Profiling dialog, select <STRONG>Highlight Covered Code...</STRONG>, and 
click the <STRONG>Calls</STRONG> tab.</P>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_mult_4.gif">

<P>While the multiplication loop still contains commands
that are called most often, the absolute numbers are
drastically reduced, a direct result of choosing a superior
algorithm. The highest number of calls on a line is now 
41 instead of 15007, and the total processing time has been
reduced to 1,465 microseconds. This occurs in the command that decides 
between incremental and halving steps. We also 
see that the halving step is called more often than the
incremental step (about twice as often in fact). This is not
surprising considering that it is this step that reduces the overall number of
iterations through the loop.</P>


<H2><A NAME="six">Step Six: Saving Profile Data</A></H2>

<P>You can use the <STRONG>Save Data</STRONG> button in the Code Coverage and 
Profiling dialog to export coverage information in a
standard format for post-processing with external tools like
Excel, statistics applications, etc. Clicking this button writes
the current profiling information in CSV format to a file.</P>

<P>The generated file contains the following columns:</P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_NrCallsToCmd">NrCallsToCmd</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Number of calls to the described command</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Filename">Filename</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Name of the file it is in</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Min">Min</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Minimum amount of time, in microseconds, spent on the executed command</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Avg">Avg</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Average amount of time, in microseconds, spent on the executed command</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Max">Max</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Maximum amount of time, in microseconds, spent on the executed command</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Total">Total</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Total amount of time, in microseconds, spent on the executed command</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_CmdLine">CmdLine</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Line in the named file the command is on</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_CmdCharIndex">CmdCharIndex</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Index of the command in the named file in characters</dd>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_CmdLength">CmdLength</A></STRONG></dt>
<DD>Length of the command in characters</dd>
</DL>


<H3><A NAME="example">Example</A></H3>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_mult_5.gif">

<P>Look at the first row in the Excel spreadsheet pictured above. The command on
line 13 of "mult_1_run.tcl" was called 15007 times. The first character of the
command is the 129th character in the file (counting EOL as one character),
and the command consists of 10 characters.</P>

<P>You can view profiling information for both of the tutorial projects in the
files "mult_1.csv" and "mult_2.csv", located in the same directory as the tutorial
files.</P>
