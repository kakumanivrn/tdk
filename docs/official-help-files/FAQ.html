<h2><a name="install">Why does the Tcl Dev Kit installer say it cannot find the Tcl Dev Kit package?</a></h2>

<p>If the Tcl Dev Kit installer generates a message that it cannot find the Tcl Dev Kit 
package, it is likely that the TCL_LIBRARY variable is set in your 
environment.  (Installing the Ruby language, for example, automatically sets 
this variable.) This variable is unnecessary, and should be removed. 

<p>Windows 9x users can remove the variable by editing their autoexec.bat file. 
Reboot the system when complete.</p>

<p>Windows XP (or later) users can remove the variable by altering their Environment Settings:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Right click on <strong>My Computer</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
	<li>On the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, select "Environment Variables..."</li>
	<li>Select the TCL_LIBRARY variable, and click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="dist_comp">How do I distribute programs compiled with the Tcl Dev Kit Compiler?</a></h2>

<p>The <a class="doc" href="Compiler.html">Tcl Dev Kit Compiler</a>  
generates bytecode representations of Tcl scripts for the purpose of obscuring 
and securing the code.  However, compiled applications do not include a Tcl 
interpreter, and thus rely on an interpreter installed on the client machine.</p>

<p>The ActiveTcl distribution includes a <code>tbcload</code> library that is 
free to distribute, and can be used to load compiled applications. Alternatively, 
use <a class="doc" href="TclApp.html">TclApp</a> to generate a compiled 
application that includes an interpreter and the required libraries.</p>

<h2><a name="tclapp_rel_paths">Why can't my TclApp-wrapped application access wrapped files via relative
paths?</a></h2>

<p>A wrapped application inherits the current working directory from the
shell where the application was run. Runtime support does not change the
current working directory to a location inside of the wrapped application
before running it. Therefore, you must use a method such as
<code>set base $starkit::topdir</code> to specify the base path. See
<a class="doc" href="tclapp.html#path_handling">Path Handling</a> in the "Converting Prowrap Projects
to TclApp Projects" section of the TclApp documentation for more information.</p>


<h2><a name="require_tk">Why are Tk commands not recognized when I wrap my application with Tk in a Linux environment?</a></h2>

<p>You must add a 'package require Tk' command to your script to successfully
wrap an application with Tk in a Linux environment.</p>

<h2><a name="starkitstarpack">What are Starkits and Starpacks?</a></h2>

<p>A <strong>starkit</strong> is a single file that packages a set of Tcl
scripts, platform-specific compiled code and application data. It relies on
an external run-time interpreter. A <strong>starpack</strong> is a single
executable file that contains both a starkit and an interpreter.</p>

<p>TclApp generates a starpack when a base kit is specified as a build
option. Specify a base kit in the <strong>Prefix file</strong> field on the
<a class="doc" href="TclApp.html#application_gui">Wrapping Tab</a> in the graphical
TclApp, or using the <a class="doc" href="TclApp.html#interp">-prefix</a>
option on the command line. See
<a class="doc" href="TclApp.html#interp">Specifying the Interpreter:
Creating Starpacks and Starkits</a> in the TclApp section for more
information.</p>

<p>See <a class="doc" target="blank" href="http://www.equi4.com/191">http://www.equi4.com/191</a> 
for an <strong>Anatomy of a starkit</strong>.</p>


<h2><a name="cust_basekit">How do I create a custom base kit?</a></h2>

<p>"Base kits" are executable files that include an interpreter. Base kits can 
be included in applications generated by <a class="doc" href="tclapp.html">TclApp</a> in
order to generate a standalone, portable application (a "starpack").</p>

<p>The Tcl Dev Kit includes two platform-specific base kits: base-tcl* and
base-tk* (which is the equivalent of base-tcl plus tk). Custom base kits can
also be included in applications generated by TclApp. For example, custom
base kits would be required to use old build systems which create only static
libs.</p>

<p>Before customizing the build process to create a custom tclkit, ensure
that the standard tclkit will build without errors.</p>


<p>Note that as the resulting applications containing your static libraries are
different from the original tclkits, to avoid confusion they should not be named
"tclkit". For example, ActiveState calls the binaries provided with the
Tcl Dev Kit "base-kits".</p>

<p>For more information, see the starkit mailing list at
<a target="blank" href="http://www.equi4.com/277">http://www.equi4.com/277</a>.
This list is for the general discussion of starkits and tclkits.</p>



<h3>UNIX</h3>

<p>Jean-Claude Wippler provides instructions and a script for generating base
kits on his site, located at
<a target="blank" href="http://www.equi4.com/218">http://www.equi4.com/218</a>. 
The primary consideration for creating custom base kits is the inclusion of
your own static libraries. These must be specified in the following locations:</p>

<h4>The Tclkit Sources</h4>

<p>The static libraries must be included in the sources of tclkit, so that
the package is initialized at runtime. The relevant source file is
<code>kit/src/kitInit.c</code>. (This file is extracted from the archive
<code>kit.tar.gz</code>, retrieved during the kit-building process.)
<code>kit/src/kitInit.c</code> contains slightly non-standard initialization 
code for a tcl core / application. However, the parts where packages are   
initialized are standard.</p>

<p>Note that <code>kit/src/kitInit.c</code> does not include headers for any
packages. Instead, it contains the relevant <code>extern...</code>
declarations for the <code><em>package</em>_Init</code> functions.</p>

  
<h4>The Linking Phase of Tclkit</h4>


<p>Create a file called <code>genkit.local</code> in the directory where
genkit is called. This file contains the following statements:</p>

<pre>
    set Z(tclsuff) &lt;your static libraries&gt;
    set Z(tksuff)  &lt;your static libraries&gt;
</pre>

<p>"<em>your static libraries</em>" might be something like:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;path&gt;/libFOO.a
</pre>

<p>...or:</p>

<pre>
    -L&lt;path&gt; -lfoo.
</pre>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>The <code>kit.tar.gz</code> file described in the previous section has a
subdirectory called "msvc6", which provides MSVC++ workspace and project
files for the creation of a tclkit on Windows.</p>


<p>The expected directory layout is:</p>

<pre> 
    tclkit/msvc6/kit.dsw etc
    Dists/Tcl/...
         /Tk/...
         /Mk4tcl/...
         /Vfs/...
         /Itcl/...
         /Zlib/...
    Build/
</pre>

<p>"tclkit" is the directory provided by kit.tar.gz. The "Build" directory is
for temporary files. The "Dists" directory is populated with the contents
of the tar files retrieved from
<a target="blank" href="http://www.equi4.com/pub/tk/tars/">http://www.equi4.com/pub/tk/tars/</a>.
(On UNIX, as described above, this retrieval is done by "genkit").</p>

<p>The results of the build are <code>kit.exe</code> and
<code>kitsh.exe</code> in the tclkit/ directory. These are incomplete
executables. To complete the generation, use:</p>

<pre>
    cat kitsh.exe tclkit/runtime.kit &gt; tclkitsh.exe
    cat kit.exe tclkit/runtime.kit &gt; tclkit.exe
</pre>

<p>Insertion of your own libraries has to happen in
<code>tclkit/src/kitInit.c</code> (as described in the UNIX section above),
and in the link step of the MSVC project.</p>

<h2><a name="mult_versions">Can I install multiple versions of the TDK?</a></h2>

<p>Yes. The behavior will vary depending on your operating system.</p>

<h3>Unix</h3>

<p>On Unix, install different versions of the Tcl Dev Kit in different 
directories. Alter the system's <code>PATH</code> variable to specify the 
<code>bin</code> directory of the desired installation.</p>


<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>When installing multiple versions of the Tcl Dev Kit on Windows, the 
following considerations apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The installer for ActiveTcl and the TDK both prepend their path info
  to the user/global PATH environment variable (depending on whether the 
  user or administrator (all) option is chosen during the installation).
  This means that the last installed version is first on the path.
  Modify the PATH environment variable by right-clicking the 
  <strong>My Computer</strong> icon, selecting the <strong>Properties</strong> 
  menu item, then selecting the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab and altering the 
  variable in the <strong>Environment Variables</strong> dialog.</li>
  
  <li>The ActiveTcl and TDK installers create or modify the system's association 
  for files with the <code>.tcl</code> extension. This association is 
  modified to point to the version of <code>wish</code> included in the 
  installation package. (When you invoke a file with this extension, 
  the file is run using the version of <code>wish</code> specified in 
  the file association.) To manually modify this setting (and thus associate the 
  <code>.tcl</code> extension with another version of <code>wish</code>), 
  modify the system's File Types setting. In Windows Explorer, select 
  <strong>Tools | Folder Options | File Types</strong> and configure the 
  association to point to the desired interpreter.</li>
  
  <li>Each version of the Tcl Dev Kit will create its own program group 
  (accessed via the Windows Start menu). Regardless of the PATH or file 
  associations, the menu items within the program group will link to the 
  version of the Tcl Dev Kit included in the installation. The demonstration 
  programs, however, may in some cases use the PATH and / or file associations 
  to determine the location of the Tcl Dev Kit binaries.</li>
  
  <li>During uninstallation, the version being uninstalled will remove
  any environment setting it made, if those settings are still set to the 
  value configured by the installation.  That means if you modify the 
  <code>.tcl</code> association after installing a new version, uninstalling 
  that version will not remove the <code>.tcl</code> association.</li>
  
</ul>

<h2><a name="tap_location">Where are the .tap files located?</a></h2>

<p>TclApp Package definition (.tap) files are reorganized in the 3.x
distribution of the Tcl Dev Kit. The majority of .tap files have undergone
a conversion that facilitates moving them with a package directory. These
.tap files are now located under the packages they belong to, for example:</p>

<pre>
    TclDevKit3.0/lib/bwidget1.6/
      bwidget.tap
</pre>

<p><strong>or</strong></p>

<pre>
    TclDevKit3.1/lib/tcllib1.5/
      tcllib.tap
</pre>


<p>The .tap files that have not undergone the conversion remain located in
the <code>tap</code> directory under the Tcl Dev Kit installation,
for example:</p>

<pre>
    TclDevKit3.x/lib/tap/
      expwin.tap
      snack.tap
</pre>


<h2><a name="tap_moving">How does TclApp find moved packages and .tap files?</a></h2>

<p>Add the <code>@TAPDIR@</code> placeholder in the .tap file you want to move,
and then put the .tap file in the same directory as the package file. The .tap
file now moves with the package directory and TclApp can find the correct files
to wrap, relative to the location of the .tap file.</p>


<h2><a name="custom_tap_moving">How does TclApp find custom .tap files for
packages not included with the Tcl Dev Kit?</a></h2>

<p>There are two solutions:</p>

<strong>1. Set the Environment Variable to the Directory</strong>
<p>Put all your .tap files in a custom directory and set the environment
variable <code>TCLAPP_PKGPATH</code> to that directory.</p>

<strong>2. Set a Placeholder</strong>
<p>In your .tap files, use the <code>@TAPDIR@</code> placeholder as a reference
for the package directory, and then put the .tap file in the same directory as
the package files. TclApp finds the correct files to wrap, relative
to the location of the .tap file.</p>

<h2><a name="error_in_startup_script">What can cause an "Error in
startup script"?</a></h2>

<p> If the implentation of a package tells Tcl what version it is
(e.g. 1.3.1) and the index file of that package (pkgIndex.tcl - used
by Tcl to map from versions to implementations) is not consistent with
the implementation (e.g. maps version 1.3 to the implementation of
version 1.3.1), an error in the startup script may occur.</p>

<p>This can affect ActiveTcl 8.5 if it is used in conjunction with an
older ActiveTcl for the packages to use. We have no hard data which
old releases are problematical, and which are good. ActiveTcl 8.4.9
has at least one package with an inconsistency of this type, i.e.
starkit 1.3 vs 1.3.1.</p>

<p>TclApp is only indirectly affected, and only TclApp. The result of
its operation may fail if a Tcl 8.5 basekit was used, and packages
having the inconsistency were wrapped as well. These packages may
have come from older versions of ActiveTcl, or they may be packages
the user of Tclapp has developed locally, i.e. company internal
packages, etc.</p>
