<H1>Compiler</H1>

<p>Traditionally, Tcl code has been distributed in source form. This had the 
advantage of being simple to use and allowing users to customize the code, but 
it had some disadvantages: you can't keep proprietary information secret and it 
may be harder to support users if they modify the code. Tcl Dev Kit Compiler eliminates
these disadvantages by translating the Tcl scripts into bytecode format. 
You can distribute bytecode files to users to protect your intellectual 
property and simplify support.</p>



<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></H2>

<p>Tcl code was traditionally interpreted on an as-needed basis. Before Tcl Version 8.0, the Tcl core did not include
an internal compiler. Tcl Version 8.0 included a compiler; however, this compiler was internal to the interpreter, and
compiled scripts could not be saved for later use. Tcl Dev Kit Compiler lets you compile scripts independently of execution,
then store them so you can load and execute the bytecode file when you want to.

<p>When you use Tcl Dev Kit Compiler, the bytecode file is stored as Tcl byte codes with the default extension <em>
.tbc</em>. For example: if you compile the script <em>foo.tcl</em> with Tcl Dev Kit Compiler, the bytecode file is stored as <em>
foo.tbc</em>. When you want to use the bytecode file, you can <strong>source</strong> it without spending the time to recompile <em>
foo.tcl</em>.

<p>You can distribute a bytecode file; this allows you to avoid shipping the Tcl source code, thus keeping your code
secure. Bytecode files can also be used with TclApp to create bundled applications that don't require special
installation; see <a class="doc" href="TclApp.html">TclApp</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Tcl Dev Kit Compiler supports Tcl versions 8.4 and later.</p>


<a class="topText" href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" height="11" width="11" border="0"/>Top</a>

<!--<h2><a name="SupportedV">Supported Versions</a></H2>

<p>The Tcl Dev Kit includes two compilers: <code>procomp.exe</code> (Windows) and 
<code>procomp</code> (unix) for generating bytecode files for Tcl 8.3; 
<code>procomp84.exe</code> (Windows) and <code>procomp8.4</code> (unix) for 
generating bytecode files for Tcl 8.4. If you are using 8.4 features or components 
in your script, you must compile using the 8.4 compiler.</p>

<p>Bytecode files compiled with the Procomp version that supports Tcl 8.3 
must be loaded with version 1.3 or greater of the <strong>tbcload</strong> 
package. Bytecode files compiled with the Procomp version that supports Tcl 
8.4 must be loaded with version 1.4 of the <strong>tbcload</strong> package.

<p>The <strong>tbcload</strong> version 1.3 package does <em>not</em> support 
version 1.0 bytecode files (generated by the Tcl Dev Kit Compiler 1.0). See 
<a class="doc" href="#DistBytecode">Distributing Bytecode Files</a>
for more information on the <strong> tbcload</strong> package.</p>

<h2><a name="compiling">Using the Command-Line Compiler</a></H2>

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler compiles Tcl files, creating bytecode output
files with a <em>.tbc</em> extension.</p>

<p>To run the Tcl Dev Kit Compiler at the command line on Windows,
enter <code>tclcompiler.exe</code>. To run the Tcl Dev Kit Compiler in
a Unix shell, enter <code>tclcompiler</code>. The examples shown below
are for Windows.</p>

<p>The <strong>-help</strong> flag displays help on all available
command-line options.</p>

<h4>Compiling a Tcl script</h4>

<p>To compile a Tcl script:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>tclcompiler.exe &lt;filename&gt;.tcl</code>
</blockquote>

<p>This command creates the output file <em>filename.tbc</em>.

<p>You can specify multiple input file names on the command line; the
bytecode files will have the same basenames as the input file, but
with the <em>.tbc</em> extension. You can use wildcards in the file
names following <strong>glob</strong> conventions. For example, to
compile all <em>.tcl</em> files in <em>C:&#92;dir1</em>:

<blockquote>
<code>tclcompiler.exe c:&#92;dir1&#92;*.tcl</code>
</blockquote>

<p>The output files are created in the same directory as the input
files.</p>

<h4>Setting the Output Filename</h4>

<p>To rename a file while compiling it, use the <strong>-out</strong>
flag (<strong>tclcompiler.exe -out </strong><em>newfilename
oldfilename</em>). For example, to rename <em>foo.tcl</em> to
<em>bar.tst</em>, you would type:</p>
    
<blockquote>
<code>tclcompiler.exe -out bar.tst foo.tcl</code>
</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>-out</strong> flag can also specify a directory. For
example:</p>

<blockquote>
<code>tclcompiler.exe -out c:&#92;dir2 c:&#92;dir1&#92;*.tcl</code>
</blockquote>

<p>This generates a set of files in <em>C&#92;:dir2</em> with the same
basename as the input files and a <em>.tbc</em> extension. You can
only specify a single input file if the <strong>-out</strong> flag
does not specify a directory.</p>

<p>The special value 'stdout' causes the application to write the
result to <code>stdout</code> instead of a file.</p>
 
<h4>Overwriting Existing Output Files</h4>

<p>You can force the Compiler to overwrite existing output files that
using the <strong>-force</strong> flag. This deletes the output
file before running Tcl Dev Kit Compiler to ensure that the
compilation does not fail because of permission errors. Because Tcl
Dev Kit Compiler creates the output file with the same permissions as
the input file, the <em>.tbc</em> file generated from a read-only
<em>.tcl</em> file is also read-only. As a result, recompiling a
read-only file will fail unless you specify the
<strong>-force</strong> flag.</p>

<h4>Compiler Feedback</h4>

<p>There are two options that control the level of feedback from the compiler. 
If the <strong>-quiet</strong> option is specified, warnings about non-existent 
files will be suppressed. If the <strong>-verbose</strong> option is specified, 
the progress of the compiler will be displayed.</p>

<h4><a name="compiling_cfg">Specifying an External Configuration File</a></h4>

<p>The <strong>-config <em>CONFIG_FILE</em></strong> switch is used to specify 
a file that contains additional configuration options. The contents of the 
file are processed as if they were specified on the command line as option
modifiers.</p>

<p>A configuration file may contain additional <strong>-config</strong> 
specifications. However, the recursive inclusion of a file is not permitted.</p>

<p>This option does accept a Compiler Project File as configuration
file as well.</p>

<h2><a name="compiling_gui">Using the Graphical Compiler</a></H2>

<p>The Tcl Dev Kit Graphical Compiler is a graphical interface for the 
Tcl Dev Kit Compiler. To launch the graphical 
compiler, select <strong>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler</strong> from the Tcl Dev Kit
program group on the Windows Start menu. Alternatively, enter
<code>tclcompiler.exe</code> at the command prompt. On Unix, enter
<code>tclcompiler</code> at the shell prompt without any arguments.</p>

<p>When running the graphical compiler on Unix systems, the 
<strong>DISPLAY</strong> environment variable must refer to a valid X display 
to launch the program.</p> 

<p><strong>Field and Color Conventions</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Case Sensitivity:</strong> Path and file name specifications 
  are not case sensitive on the Windows platform, but are case-sensitive on 
  Unix platforms.</li>
  <li><strong>Directory Slashes:</strong> Either forward slashes or back slashes 
  can be used to indicate directories on the Windows platform. On Unix platforms, 
  directories can only be specified with forward slashes.</li>
  <li><strong>Field Colors:</strong> When a non-existent path or file is 
  specified, the field will be displayed with a yellow background. If 
  the contents of the field are valid, the field is displayed with a white 
  background.</li>
  <li><strong>Tooltips:</strong> Context-sensitive tooltips are displayed when 
  the mouse pointer hovers fields in the graphical compiler. These are 
  especially useful when a yellow field background indicates an error, as the 
  tooltip will provide explanatory information about the error.</li>
  <li><strong>Changing Font Size:</strong> Use <code>Ctrl-plus</code> to increase
  the font size displayed in the Compiler or <code>Ctrl-minus</code> to decrease
  the displayed font size. If you are using Windows with a mouse wheel, you can
  alternatively press the <code>Ctrl</code> key and then rotate the mouse wheel
  to increase or decrease the font size displayed in the Compiler.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Compiler Projects</h3>

<p>Compiler project definitions are stored in text files with <em>.tpj</em> extensions. 
When the Tcl Dev Kit graphical compiler is first invoked, no project is loaded.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>To load an existing project:</strong> select <strong>Load 
Project</strong> from the File menu.</p>

<p><strong>To save a project:</strong> select <strong>Save Project</strong> from 
the File menu, and specify a directory location and project name for the 
project file.</p>

<p><strong>To create a new project:</strong> select <strong>New</strong> from 
the File menu.  This will reset the fields in the Graphical Compiler to their 
default state.</p>

</blockquote>


<h3>Specifying Input Files</h3>

<p>Use the <strong>Files</strong> tab to specify the input files that should 
be included in the output file. Each file specified on this tab will result 
in an individual, compiled output file.</p>

<img border="1" src="images/Compiler-1.gif">

<blockquote>

<p><strong>To add a file</strong> specify the full path and file name in the 
field at the top, then click the <strong>Add</strong> button or press Enter 
to add it to the file list.  Alternatively, click the <strong>Browse...</strong> 
button to the right of the field, navigate to the desired file, then click the 
<strong>Add</strong> button to add it to the file list.</p>

<p><strong>To remove a file</strong> click the desired file in the file list, 
then click the <strong>Remove</strong> button or press the Delete key. To 
select multiple files, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking the desired 
file names.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Compiler Options</h3>

<p>Use the <strong>Options</strong> tab to configure the compiler options for 
the generated bytecode file.</p>

<img border="1" src="images/Compiler-2.gif">

<p>Available options include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Force overwrite</strong> if this box is checked, the compiler 
  will overwrite all output files before compiling the project. (This option 
  corresponds to the command-line compiler's <strong>-force</strong> option.) 
  Because the compiled file inherits the permissions of the input file, this 
  function prevents compiler failure when the input file is read-only.</li>
  <li><strong>Destination Directory</strong> specify the directory where 
  the output file should be created.  Alternatively, click the 
  <strong>Browse...</strong> button to the right of the field to navigate to the 
  desired output directory. If no output directory is specified, the bytecode 
  file will be generated in the same directory as the original script.</li>
  <li><strong>Prefix handling</strong> to add startup code to the output file, 
  specify a prefix.  The options are:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>None</strong> do not add prefix string.</li>
      <li><strong>Auto</strong> extract the prefix from the input file; 
      everything from the start of the input file to the first non-comment line 
      is inserted at the top of the output file.</li>
      <li><strong>Tag</strong> extract the prefix from the input file; 
      everything from the start of the file to the first occurrence of a comment 
      line starting with the text &quot;Tcl::Compiler::Include&quot; is inserted 
      at the top of the output file.</li>
      <li><strong>Specify file:</strong> extract the prefix text from the specified file; 
      specify the full path and filename, or click the <strong>Browse...</strong> 
      button to the right of the field to navigate for the file.</li> 
   </ul>
   
   <p>The Prefix handling option corresponds to the command-line compiler's 
   <strong>-prefix</strong> option.  For more information on prefix insertion, see 
   <a class="doc" href="#prefix">Inserting Code Before the Script</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Generating Bytecode Files</h3>

<p>Use the <strong>Run</strong> tab to generate the bytecode output file.  
If the activity field is blank and the <strong>Compile</strong> button is enabled, 
the project configuration contains no errors and is ready to run. If the project 
configuration contains errors, an interpretive message with a red background 
will be displayed in the activity field, and the <strong>Compile</strong> 
button will be disabled. You must fix the errors on the Files or Options tab 
before you can compile the project.</p>

<img border="1" src="images/Compiler-3.gif">


<p>The activity field will display the actions of the compiler, including the 
flags that correspond to the command-line compiler and the name of the input and 
output files. The output file will have the same name as the input file, with 
the extension <em>.tbc</em>. Compiler error messages will be displayed with a red 
background.</p>

<h2><a name="bytecode">Bytecode Files</a></H2>

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler creates an internal representation of the Tcl script
using the Tcl bytecode compiler that is built into the Tcl core. It performs
additional computations, and then emits a representation of the bytecode file to
the output file. The output file itself is a simple Tcl script that loads the
bytecode run-time package, <strong> tbcload</strong>, and then invokes a command
in that package to load and run the bytecode files.

<p>Bytecode files are just Tcl scripts, in other words, <strong>platform
independent</strong>. This allows you to use bytecodes anywhere you would use Tcl
scripts.  For example: you can <strong>source</strong> bytecode files. You can
store a <em>.tbc</em> script in a Tcl variable, for example, by reading the
<em>.tbc</em> file or reading it from a socket and then execute it using the
<strong> eval</strong> command.

<p>The <em>.tbc</em> extension is used to not conflict with your existing source
file. You may rename it to <em>.tcl</em> for deployment purposes.

<p>The Tcl Dev Kit comes with the source for the package <strong>tbcload
</strong>, allowing you to compile this package for any platform you might need
it for. The platform independence of <em>.tbc</em> files means that it is possible
to generate the bytecompiled files on any of the platforms supported by the Tcl
Dev Kit, and then to transfer the results to the platform to run them on.


<h3><a name="prefix">Inserting Code Before the Script</a></H3>

<p>Because the bytecode file is a Tcl script, there might be situations where you want to add some
specialized setup code at the start of the script. For example, if you want to directly execute a script file
under Unix, it should start with the following lines:</p>
    
<blockquote>
<code>
#!/bin/sh<BR>
# the next line restarts using tclsh &#92;<BR>
exec tclsh &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$@&quot;</code>
</blockquote>

<p>By default, Tcl Dev Kit Compiler preserves everything from the start of the file to the first non-blank or
non-comment line. Therefore in this example, Tcl Dev Kit Compiler adds these three lines to the top of the script 
it generates.</p>

<p>You can override this default behavior with the <strong>-prefix</strong> option. 
This controls which prefix is written to the output file.</p>

<h2><a name="behavior">Changes In Behavior</a></H2>

<p>There are few differences between the behavior of bytecode files and Tcl scripts that are not compiled.
This section explains these differences.

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler has the following limitations:

<ul>
    <li>Only those procedures that are defined at the top level can be compiled. </LI>
    <li>The <strong>info body</strong> command on compiled procedures does not 
    provide meaningful information:
    See <a class="doc" href="#Ex1">Cloning Procedures</a></LI>
</ul>

<p>However, these limitation do not prevent the affected procedures from being compiled at runtime. The
contents of the bytecode file are a representation of the internal structures of the compiled Tcl script, without
the source code. Procedures defined in the source file are compiled and their internal structures are also
stored without source code. Thus, compiled procedure bodies cannot be read or accessed through the <strong>
info body</strong> command. As a consequence, you cannot depend on being able to read procedure bodies
in the bytecode, as shown in <a class="doc" href="#Ex1">Example 1</a>.

<p>The command <strong>info body</strong> on a compiled procedure cannot return the actual body of the
procedure because that information is not available. Instead, it returns a fabricated script containing:
<ul>
    <li>A comment, which identifies this body of code as belonging to a compiled procedure.</LI>
    <li>An error command: this is used as an aide in detecting unsupported uses of <strong>info body</strong>
, as shown in <a class="doc" href="#Ex1">Example 1</a>.
</ul>

<h3><a name="Ex1">Example: Cloning Procedures</a></H3>

<p>Scripts that use the bodies of procedures in computations will not work properly if the procedures have
been compiled. For example, the script below uses <strong>info body</strong> to extract the body of one
procedure and use it to create another procedure that is identical.

<blockquote>
<code>
#clone.tcl--<BR>
proc len {a} {<BR>
    return [string length $a]<BR>
}<BR>
proc len1 {a} [info body len]<BR>
puts &quot;[len {abc}] + [len1 {monkey}]&quot;</code>
</blockquote>

<p>The two calls to <strong>proc</strong> create two procedures, <strong>len</strong> and <strong>
len1</strong>, with identical bodies.

<p>If you run the <em>clone.tcl</em> file, you get this output:
    
<blockquote>
<code>C:&gt; tclsh clone.tcl<br>
<BR>
3 + 6
</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Bytecode files, however, do not contain any sources for compiled procedure bodies, and <strong>
info body</strong> returns a standard value.

<p>If you run the <em>clone.tbc</em> file, you get this output:

<blockquote>
<code>C:&gt; tclsh clone.tbc<br>
 <BR>
called a copy of a compiled script<BR>
while executing<BR>
&quot;error &quot;called a copy of a compiled script&quot;&quot;<BR>
(procedure &quot;len1&quot; line 2)<BR>
invoked from within<BR>
&quot;# Compiled -- no source code available<BR>
error &quot;called a copy of a compiled script&quot;&quot;<BR>
invoked from within<BR>
&quot;tbcload::bceval {<BR>
Tcl Dev Kit ByteCode 1 0 1.3 8.2<BR>
6 0 49 12 0 0 28 0 6 6 6 -1 -1<BR>
49<BR>

6=t-Ow+...&quot;<BR>
(file &quot;clone.tbc&quot; line 17) </code>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that the call to <strong>len1</strong> resulted in an error being thrown;
this error comes from the script returned by the <strong>info body len</strong> command. The script throws
the error rather than failing silently to help you to detect unsupported uses of <strong>
info body</strong> command. If you need to use the body of a procedure in a computation,
do not compile that procedure.</p>
         
<a class="topText" href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" height="11" width="11" border="0"/>Top</a>

<h2><a name="compiled">What Is And Isn't Compiled</a></H2>

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler will compile most of the Tcl code in your applications, but it can't compile absolutely every
Tcl command. Where Tcl Dev Kit Compiler cannot compile a command it leaves it in text form where it will
be compiled at runtime when the command is invoked. Your bytecode files will still execute correctly even
if some commands aren't compiled, but uncompiled commands mean that part of your source is more easily
accessible to your users. This section discusses what Tcl Dev Kit Compiler can and cannot compile.

<p>When it compiles a script, Tcl Dev Kit Compiler divides the script up into its component Tcl commands and
compiles each one. If Tcl Dev Kit Compiler can determine that the argument to a command is a Tcl script,
then it compiles that script also. However, if Tcl Dev Kit Compiler can't determine that an argument is a script,
then it leaves that argument as a string. For example, Tcl Dev Kit Compiler can identify all the Tcl scripts used
as arguments to standard Tcl commands, such as the bodies of <strong>if</strong>, <strong>while</strong>,
and <strong>proc</strong> commands. However, in the following script Tcl Dev Kit Compiler can't tell that the
argument to the <strong>do10</strong> procedure is a script:

<blockquote>
<code>
proc do10 {script} { <BR>
    for {set i 1} {$i &lt;= 10} {incr i} { <BR>
        eval $script <BR>
    } <BR>
}<BR>
do10 {puts &quot;hello&quot;}</code>
</blockquote>

<p>In general, if you write a procedure that takes a script as an argument, Tcl Dev Kit Compiler can't tell that
the argument is a script, rather than, say, an ordinary string value, so it can't compile that argument.
Again, the bytecode file will behave correctly; the unknown argument will be compiled when it is actually executed.

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler has these limitations:

<ul>
    <li>[incr Tcl] code is not compiled.</LI>
    <li>Bodies of dynamically created procedures cannot be compiled.</LI>
    <li>Procedures within the scope of <strong>namespace eval</strong> are not compiled </LI>
</ul>

<p>The following example illustrates the constraints with procedures and namespaces.

<h3>Example 2: Procedures used with Namespace</H3>

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler does not currently understand the <strong>namespace eval</strong> command enough
to know that arguments to <strong>namespace eval</strong> form a Tcl script, so that nothing that follows <strong>
namespace eval</strong> is compiled, including procedures.

<p>Example 2 shows two procedures: a procedure defined inside a <strong>namespace eval</strong> construct
and one defined outside it. In this example, <strong>namespace eval</strong> prevents procedure bodies
from being compiled.

<blockquote>
<code>
# Example2.tcl--<BR>
namespace eval sample {<BR>
    namespace export not_compiled compiled<BR>
<BR>
    proc not_compiled {a1 a2} {<BR>
        return [list $a1 $a2]<BR>
    }<BR>
}<BR>
    proc sample::compiled {a1 a2} {<BR>
    puts &quot;hello&quot;<BR>
}</code>
</blockquote>

<a class="topText" href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" height="11" width="11" border="0"/>Top</a>

<h2><a name="components">Compiler Components</a></H2>

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler is made up of two components:
<ul>
    <li>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler generates a bytecode file from a Tcl script containing internal structures.
    See <a class="doc" href="#CreatePackIdx">Creating Package Indexes</a>.</LI>
    <li>The runtime loader, <strong>tbcload</strong>, takes the bytecode file, loads the bytecodes into an interpreter,
    and executes them. See <a class="doc" href="#DistBytecode">Distributing Bytecode Files</a>.</LI>
</UL>

<h3><a name="CreatePackIdx">Creating Package Indexes</a></H3>

<p>After you compile Tcl package scripts into <em>.tbc</em> files, you can use the Tcl command <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong>
to create package index files for your <em>.tbc</em> files. After creating the index files, users of your
package will transparently load your bytecode files instead of the original script. Creating package index files for
<em>.tbc</em> files requires the <strong>pkg_mkIndex -load tbcload</strong> option:

<blockquote>
<code>C:&gt; tclsh</code><br>
<code>% <strong>pkg_mkIndex -load tbcload</strong> <em>$dir</em> <strong>*.tbc</strong></code><br>
<code>% exit</code><br>
<code>C:&gt;</code>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: You must use Tcl 8.0.5 or later to create package index files for your
<em>.tbc</em> files.

<h3><a name="DistBytecode">Distributing Bytecode Files</a></H3>

<p>The <strong>tbcload</strong> package is available with ActiveTcl as a dynamically-loaded library (such as a <em>.dll</em>
on Windows and <em>.so</em> on Solaris) file. The library exports the two package initialization procedures:
<strong>Tbcload_Init</strong> and <strong>Tbcload_SafeInit</strong>, which are required by the Tcl <strong>load</strong>
command. You can use the shared library as you would any other Tcl package:

<ul>
    <li>Use <strong>pkg_mkIndex</strong> to create a package index file.</LI>
    <li>Make sure that the shared library and index file are placed in a directory accessible to the package load mechanism.</LI>
</ul>

<p>If you follow the above guidelines, you can ship your bytecode files
and the <strong>tbcload</strong> shared library to customers. <!--See <a
class="doc" href="#SupportedV">Supported Versions</a> for information on
compatible versions of Tcl/Tk, <strong> tbcload</strong>, and the
bytecode files. --></p>

<p>If you are building you own extensions, you can either use <strong>tbcload</strong> as a dynamically loaded
Tcl package as described above, or you can add it to your application as a static package. In the latter case, your <strong>
Tcl_AppInit</strong> procedure must contain the following code:
    
<blockquote><code>
#include &lt;proTbcLoad.h&gt;<BR>
<BR>
if (Tbcload_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {<BR>
    return TCL_ERROR;<BR>
}<BR>
Tcl_StaticPackage(interp, &quot;tbcload&quot;, Tbcload_Init, Tbcload_SafeInit); </code>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="errors">Compilation Errors</a></H2>

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler provides an added check that your code is syntactically correct. A benefit of compiling
procedure bodies in advance is that some syntax errors are caught at compilation rather than at runtime. Because
Tcl procedures in standard Tcl code are compiled on an as-needed basis, errors are not caught until you run the
procedures. Tcl Dev Kit Compiler informs you of errors that are caught when it compiles the file.

<p>This example shows an error message from a compilation. The file contains syntactically incorrect Tcl code.

<p>Sample for a bad file (fail.tcl):
    
<blockquote>
<code>
# note the missing close-brace <BR>
set msg {</code>
</blockquote>

<p>If you run this code in an interpreter, you see the following error message:

<blockquote>
<code>
% tclsh.exe fail.tcl<BR>
missing close-brace<BR>
    while compiling<BR>
&quot;set msg { ...&quot;<BR>
    (file &quot;fail.tcl&quot; line 15)</code>
</blockquote>

<p>If you compile, you get this output:

<blockquote>
<code>compilation of &quot;fail.tcl&quot; failed: missing close-brace</code>
</blockquote>

<p>Tcl Dev Kit Compiler saves the error generated by the compilation. In this example, Tcl Dev Kit Compiler displays the
string &quot;missing close-brace&quot; and displays the error message. You will need to fix syntax errors like
this one before Tcl Dev Kit Compiler can compile the script. For help in tracking down errors, See
<a class="doc" href="Checker.html">Tcl Dev Kit Checker</a>.</p>
