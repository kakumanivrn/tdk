<h1><a name="package_editor_overview">Package Editor</a></h1>

<p>The Package Editor is a graphical application used to define Tcl
packages in TEApot format (.zip and .tm files) or TclApp Package
format (.tap files). Both types of packages can be used by <a
class="doc" href="TclApp.html">TclApp</a>. Creating package
definitions simplifies the creation of applications in TclApp as
included files do not have to be specified individually. Packages can
be modified and re-used by multiple applications built with TclApp.</p>

<p>TEApot packages can also be hosted in a TEApot repository and made
available to ActiveTcl TEAcup clients.</p>

<p>Numerous predefined packages in .tap format are included with
ActiveTcl 8.4 and earlier. Many more packages are available from
ActiveState's TEApot repository. These packages can be installed using
ActiveTcl's <a href="tpm/tpm/files/CTP_teacup.html">TEAcup</a> client.
The Package Editor can be used to modify existing packages, regardless
of whether they are custom packages or predefined packages included
with ActiveTcl.</p>

<p>Multiple packages can be configured within the same Package Editor
project. Each package will be displayed as an individual entity in the
TclApp Package Picker dialog; however, by grouping multiple packages
together into one project, you can easily maintain file sets in
related packages.</p>

<h3><a name="start_tclpe">Starting the Package Editor</a></h3>

<p>To launch the Package Editor in Windows, select <strong>Tcl Dev Kit
Package Editor</strong> from the Tcl Dev Kit program group on the
Windows Start menu. Alternatively, you can invoke the Package Editor
from the command line. On Windows, enter <code>tclpe.exe</code> at the
command prompt. On Unix, enter <code>tclpe</code> at the shell prompt.</p>

<p>Project files can be specified at the command line. For example:</p>

<pre>
  tclpe -gui myproject.tap
</pre>

<p>Types of files that can be loaded as projects include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>teapot.txt files (TEApot package descriptors)
  <li>.tap files (TclApp packages)
  <li>starkits and starpacks</li>
  <li>zip archives</li>
  <li>tcl modules</li>
</ul>

<p>Use 'Ctrl-plus' and 'Ctrl-minus' to increase or decrease the
displayed font size. Alternatively, use 'Ctrl-mouse wheel'.</p>

<h2><a name="tea_packages">Teapot Packages</a></h2>

<p>To create a project for packages in TEApot format, select
<strong>New Project (Teapot)</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
menu. A new TEApot package project is created by default when 
the Package Editor is started.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_create_package">Creating a New TEApot Package</a></h3>

<p>Packages can be added to a project individually by clicking the
<strong>Create a New Package</strong> button, or imported
automatically by clicking the </strong>Scan Directory</strong> button.
In most situations where the Tcl files you want to package exist in
a particular directory (and nested sub-directories), the <strong>Scan
Directory</strong> is the simplest way to begin.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_scan_directory">Scanning Directories</a></h3>

<p><strong>Scan Directory</strong> opens a dialog box for choosing a
source directory. Enter the directory to scan in the
<strong>Destination</strong> field, or click the
<strong>Browse</strong> button on the right.</p>

<p>The Package Editor scans the source directory for a
<em>pkgIndex.tcl</em> file. If present, it will use this as a starting
point for a heuristic scan for packages and files to be included in
the project. If it is not present, the path displayed in the
<strong>Destination</strong> field will be highlighted, indicating
that scanning is not possible.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Run</strong> to initiate the scan. The output pane
below displays information on the scanning progress. Warnings
are highlighted in yellow, errors are highlighted in red.</p>

<p>Packages discovered in the scan are added to the project and appear
in the left pane where they can be reviewed.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: TEApot projects generate a file called
<em>teapot.txt</em> in the source directory when the project is saved,
so the source directory must be writable.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_package_basic">Basic TEApot Package Information</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>Basic</strong> tab is used to record general
information about the package. This information is for package
administration purposes; a subset of the information is displayed in
TclApp's <strong>Package Picker</strong> dialog, and can be used with
the <code>-pkg</code> option in the command-line version of <a
href="TclApp.html#cmdline">TclApp</a>.</p>

<img src="images/tea_pkg_desc.png">

<p>This tab includes the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Type</strong>: A drop-down list with options for
  specifying what kind of TEApot <a
  href=tpm/tpm/files/CTP_introduction.html#entities">entity</a> is
  being created:
    <ul>
      <li>Application: An Tcl based application with meta data.</li>
      <li>Package (default): A Tcl package.</li>
      <li>Profile: A named collection of references to other
      entities (i.e. meta data only).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: The entity name.</li>
  <li><strong>Version</strong>: A version number for the entity.</li>
  <li><strong>Platform</strong>: The target platform for the
  package. By default, this field shows the platform the
  Package Editor is currently running on.</li>
  <li><strong>Summary</strong>: A short summary of what the package is
  or does.</li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: A longer description of the
  package.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="tea_package_files">TEApot Package Files</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>Files</strong> tab is for specifying files for
inclusion and exclusion for the package. <strong>Scan
Directory</strong> will populate the <strong>Included Files</strong>
list with the relevant files discovered in the scan. The
<strong>Included Files</strong> and <strong>Excluded Files</strong>
fields accept glob style wildcards (e.g. "*" and "?") for specifying
multiple files with a particular extension or text string in the
name.</p>

<p>To exclude files, use the <strong>Remove</strong> button to take
files out of the list, or if glob style matching is being used in
<strong>Included Files</strong>, by adding specific files to the
<strong>Excluded Files</strong> list.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_package_requirements">TEApot Package Requirements</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>Requirements</strong> tab is for specifying the package
requirements (Tcl version, module dependencies, etc.). To add a
requirement, enter the package name or version in the entry field and
click the <strong>Add</strong> button. Requirements must be entered in
TEApot's <a
href="tpm/tpm/files/CTP_metadata.html#entity_references">entity
reference</a> syntax. If the syntax is incorrect, the text in the
entry field is highlighted, and a tooltip provides information on the
error.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_package_recommendations">TEApot Package Recommendations</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>Recommendations</strong> tab is for specifying packages
which are beneficial to, but absolutely necessary for the functioning
of the module. The interface is the same as the
<strong>Requirements</strong> tab.

<h3><a name="tea_package_Indexing">TEApot Package Indexing</a></h3>

<p>TEApot packages can contain Category and Subject meta data to make
it easier to find them in a TEApot repository (i.e. using <code>teacup
search ...</code>). The <strong>Category</strong> field is for a one
line sentence, and the <strong>Subject / Key Phrases</strong> is for a
list of words and phrases.</p>

<p>Add a Category value by entering it in the
<strong>Category</strong> text field. Add items to the Subject list by
entering words or phrases in the <strong>Subject / Key
phrases</strong> text field, then clicking the <strong>Add</strong>
button.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_package_other">TEApot Package Other Metadata</a></h3>

<p>In addition to the Category and Subject meta data, other arbitrary
and predefined meta data can be added to TEApot packages as key/value
pairs. See <a
href="tpm/tpm/files/CTP_metadata.html#keywords_with_predefined_semantics">Keywords
with predefined semantics</a> for more information on TEApot's
"reserved" keywords.</p>

<p>Enter key/value pairs in the <strong>Keyword</strong> and
<strong>Value</strong> columns respectively. Hitting 'Enter' adds the
current pair, clicking the <strong>Remove</strong> button deletes the
adjacent entry.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_save_project">Saving a TEApot Project</a></h3>

<p>After configuring a TEApot package, select <strong>File | Save
Project As</strong> to save the package definition in a file called
<em>teapot.txt</em> in the source directory. This directory must be
writable.</p>

<h3><a name="tea_generate_archive">Generating a TEApot Archive</a></h3>

<p>Once a project has been configured with all the necessary files and
data, a TEApot package archive can be created. The <strong>Generate
TEApot Archives</strong> button brings up a dialog box with the
following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Destination</strong>: The directory to save the archive
  to.</li>
  <li><strong>Archive format</strong>: Choose from tm (Tcl module),
  zip, or <a
  href="tpm/tpm/files/CTP_teazip.html#archive_type_selection">auto</a>
  (default).</li>
  <li><strong>Compile to bytecode</strong>: Invokes the Tcl compiler
  on the files in the package.</li>
  <li><strong>Timestamp the version</strong>: Adds a date/time-stamp
  to the version metadata.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these options have been set, click the <strong>Run</strong> 


<a class="topText" href="#top"><img src="images/top.gif" height="11" width="11" border="0"/>Top</a>

<h2><a name="tap_packages">TclApp Packages</a></h2>

<p>To create a project for packages in TclApp (.tap) format, select
<strong>New Project (Tap)</strong> from the <strong>File</strong>
menu.</p>

<p>The <strong>Scan Directory</strong> feature works essentially the
same in a Tap project as in a TEApot project, but does not generate a
<em>teapot.txt</em> file in the scanned directory. See <a
href="#tea_scan_directory">Scanning Directories</a> above for more
information.</p>

<h3><a name="tap_new_package">Creating a New TclApp Package</a></h3>

<p>To add a package to a project, click
<strong>Create new package</strong>. These packages can be added to a
new project or added to a project that has already been populated by
<strong>Scan Directory</strong>.

<p>By default, new packages within the project are named "New Package
<em>n</em>", where <em>n</em> is an incrementing number. This can be
modifed in the <strong>Name</strong> field on the
<strong>Basic</strong> tab.</p>

<h3><a name="tap_package_basic">Basic TclApp Package Information</a></h3>

<p>The <strong>Basic</strong> tab is used to record general
information about the package. This information is for package
administration purposes; a subset of the information is displayed in
the TclApp <a class="doc" href="TclApp.html#files_tab">Package
Picker</a> dialog, and can be used with the <a class="doc"
href="TclApp.html#cmdline">-pkg</a> option in the command-line version
of TclApp.</p>

<img src="images/tap_pkg_desc.png">

<p>This tab includes the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: The contents of this field will be displayed in 
  TclApp's Package Picker dialog. It is also the value specified when using the 
  <code>-pkg</code> switch with the command-line version of TclApp.</li>
  <li><strong>Version</strong>: The contents of this field will be displayed in 
  TclApp's Package Picker dialog. It can also be part of the value specified 
  when using the <code>-pkg</code> switch with the command-line version of 
  TclApp (specified in the form of <em>PKGNAME-VERSION</em>).</li>
  <li><strong>Platform</strong>: The contents of this field will be displayed in 
  TclApp's Package Picker dialog.</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden</strong>: If this box is checked, the package will not be 
  visible in the TclApp Package Picker dialog.</li>
  <li><strong>Same files as</strong>: This field is used to assign a file set 
  definition from an existing package to the new package. See <a class="doc" 
  href="#copying">Copying File Lists from One Package to Another</a> below.</li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: The contents of this field will be 
  displayed in TclApp's Package Picker dialog.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="copying">Copying File Lists from Another Package</a></h4>

<p>To copy a list of files from an existing package to a new package, first open 
the existing package using the <strong>File | Load Project</strong> menu 
option. Then click the <strong>New Package</strong> button.</p>

<p>While the new package is selected in the package list (on the left side of 
the Package Editor), check the <strong>Same files as</strong> box, and select 
the desired package from the drop-down list.</p>

<p>If you are creating multiple new packages at the same time, note that only 
the packages that were opened before the current package will be available 
in the <strong>Same files as</strong> drop-down list. For example, if you 
create a new package called "foo", and then create a new package called "bar", 
the "foo" files will be available to the "bar" package, but the "bar" files 
will not be available to the "foo" package.</p> 
 

<h3><a name="tap_files">Adding Files to the TclApp Package</a></h3>

<p>Use the <strong>Files</strong> tab to add files to the package. Files can 
be specified individually (beneath a "base" directory), or can be specified 
as a subset of files under a directory (for example, using wildcards).</p>

<img src="images/tap_pkg_files.png">

<p>Use the arrow buttons on the left side of the file display to move files and 
directories up and down the list. For example, files can be moved from one 
directory to another using these buttons.</p>	

<h4><a name="tap_base_dir">Adding Base Directories and Files</a></h4>

<p>Before adding individual files, you must specify a base directory. The 
base directory can be any directory that is above the desired file(s). To add 
a base directory, enter the name of the directory in the field at the top of 
the form, or click the Folder button and browse to the desired directory.</p>

<p>Files can be added by either manually entering the name in the field at 
the top of the form, or by browsing for the file using the Files button. 
When manually entering the file name, you may use wildcards to select 
groups of files with similar name characteristics. You will not be able to
add a file unless a base directory (that exists above the location of the  
file in the filesystem hierarchy) is selected in the file list.</p>

<h4><a name="tap_multi_files">Adding Multiple Files in a Directory</a></h4>

<p>Use the "Files in Directory" button to select both a base directory and 
all the files and directories beneath it. 

<h4><a name="tap_alias_path">Setting an Alias Path or File Name</a></h4>

<p>The alias button is used to specify an alternate name and / or location for 
a file. This corresponds to TclApp's <code>-alias</code> command-line switch. 
It can be used in conjunction with the TclApp <code>-relativeto</code> and 
<code>-anchor</code> switches to configure the destination filesystem.

<h4><a name="tap_include_exclude">Including or Excluding Files or Directories</a></h4>

<p>Use the <strong>Toggle Incl/Excl</strong> button to exclude files 
or directories from the TclApp application without removing from the 
package definition.</p>

<h4><a name="using_placeholders">Using Placeholders for Portability</a></h4>

<p>By default, only absolute paths can be specified as the base directory. 
This reduces the portability of package definition files, as absolute paths 
are dependent on the configuration of the system where the package definition 
file was created.</p>

<p>By replacing absolute paths with "placeholders", package definition files can 
be used on systems that do not necessarily share the same configuration. For 
example, the image above shows the use of the <code>@TCL_LIBDIR@</code> 
placeholder. When TclApp builds an application based on this package definition, 
it will substitute the <code>lib</code> directory beneath the installation 
directory of the Tcl Dev Kit on the system where TclApp is run.</p>

<p>The following placeholders can be used in place of an absolute directory 
specification:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>@TDK_INSTALLDIR@</strong>: The directory where the Tcl Dev Kit is 
  installed on the system where TclApp is run.</li>
  <li><strong>@TDK_LIBDIR@</strong>: 

The main TAP search path under which a .tap file was found. For
example: If we have the TAP search paths <code>FOO/lib</code> and
<code>BAR/lib</code>, then @TDK_LIBDIR@ is set to <code>FOO/lib</code>
for a tap file named <code>FOO/lib/sub/sub.tap</code>, and set to
<code>BAR/lib</code> for a file named <code>BAR/lib/pkg/pkg.tap</code>

</li>
  <li><strong>@TAP_DIR@</strong>: The directory where the package definition 
  file is located on the system where TclApp is run.</li>
</ul>

<p>To substitute a placeholder for an absolute path, click on the desired 
folder in the list, then click <strong>Edit</strong> and enter the desired 
placeholder.</p>
  
<h3><a name="saving_package_definition">Saving a Package Definition</a></h3>

<p>After configuring a package, select <strong>File | Save Project As</strong>
to save the package definition in a project file with a .tap extension.</p>
