<h2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</a></h2>


<P>This tutorial shows how to use the Tcl Dev Kit Debugger with coverage to
ensure that a tcltest-based testsuite for a Tcl script library
covers all paths through the code. When the "Plain coverage" option is
selected in the
<a class="doc" href="Debugger.html#ChangeProCoverage">Project Settings</a>, the
Tcl Dev Kit Debugger will highlight covered or uncovered lines in an
application and generate data about the number of calls to each line, along with
the file names and line numbers.</P>

<P>The project for this tutorial contains a library of code written 
in Tcl, and a testsuite written in Tcl that uses the <CODE>tcltest</CODE> 
package. We'll use the debugger to check which parts of the library 
are exercised by the testsuite. If we find that there 
are areas of code that are not covered, we'll extend the test 
suite to cover those paths as well.</P>

<P>The testsuite and the code library that we'll test come from 
<CODE>tcllib</CODE>, a Tcl library distributed with ActiveTcl. The module under
scrutiny is <CODE>csv</CODE>, which is used to read and write CSV ("comma separated 
values") delimited data and to CSV data to and from Tcl lists.</P>
<P>The first testsuite we'll run, <CODE>csv.test</CODE>, was extracted from 
the core Tcl file <CODE>csv_new.test</CODE>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="one">Step One: Open the Tutorial Program</A></H2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UNIX</strong>: Change to the directory 
  <CODE>/demos/TclDevKit/TclDebugger/Coverage/</CODE> beneath the root Tcl Dev Kit 
  installation directory, and run:
  
  <pre>tcldebugger csv.tpj</pre></li>
  
  <li><strong>Windows</strong>: Click <STRONG>Start | Programs | ActiveState
  Tcl Dev Kit | Tcl Dev Kit Demos | Profiling and Coverage | Coverage
  Testsuite I</STRONG></li>
</ul>


<P>The Tcl Dev Kit Debugger will open and load the <CODE>csv</CODE>
project. The Code display portion of the debugger's main window will show the
file <CODE>csv_frame.tcl</CODE>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="two">Step Two: View Unexecuted Lines</A></H2>

<P>Run the application in the debugger as usual. You can watch variables,
use the eval console, and perform all other debugging tasks while 
coverage information is being gathered in the background.</P>

<P>As the debugger executes lines in the application, lines that have 
not been executed will be displayed with a yellow background.</P>

<P>When the script has finished running, select <STRONG>View | Code Coverage</STRONG>,
or click the <strong>Coverage</strong> 
<img src="images/debug_cover_butt.gif"> button on the toolbar. The 
<STRONG>Code Coverage and Profiling</STRONG> dialog will be displayed.</P>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_csv_1.gif">


<H2><A NAME="three">Step Three: View Covered Files</A></H2>

<P>The Code Coverage and Profiling dialog has two tabs, "Files" and "Calls".
The Files tab, relevant to this tutorial, is displayed by default. It displays 
a list of all files for which the system collected coverage information.</P>

<P>Three files are listed:</P>

<ul>
  <li>csv_frame.tcl</li>
  <li>csv.tcl</li>
  <li>csv.test</li>
</ul>

<P>To view a covered file in the Code display area of the debugger's main
window, click on the file in the list, then click the <STRONG>Show Code</STRONG> 
button.</P>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_csv_2.gif">

<P>Two of the files (<CODE>csv_frame.tcl</CODE> and <CODE>csv.test</CODE>) 
contain the framework to call the testsuite, and the testsuite itself.
For the testsuite to be comprehensive, all code in the program 
(<CODE>csv.tcl</CODE>) should have been executed. Otherwise, the test is 
incomplete.</P>

<H2><A NAME="four">Step Four: View Uncovered Code</A></H2>

<P>View the uncovered code for the file <CODE>csv.tcl</CODE>. In the Code 
Coverage and Profiling dialog, select the file, then click 
<STRONG>Show Code</STRONG>. Scroll the Code display down to line 235. 
Notice that there are code paths that have not been executed.</P>

<img border="1" src="images/tut_csv_3.gif">

<P>If this were a real testsuite, you would analyze the uncovered 
code and create a test that exercises it. In this example, the 
original testsuite was deliberately altered by removing 
the tests for checking the "empty" and "auto" expansion modes 
of the <CODE>split2matrix</CODE> routine.</P>

<H2><A NAME="five">Step Five: A Complete Testsuite</A></H2>

<P>Open the second tutorial project <CODE>csv_new.tpj</CODE> (Coverage 
Testsuite II). Follow the procedure you used to <a class="doc" href="#one">open
Coverage Testsuite I</a>. This project contains the original, complete testsuite.
As with the previous example, run the program and view the uncovered code in
<CODE>csv.tcl</CODE>. All paths through the code have been covered by the full
testsuite.</P>
