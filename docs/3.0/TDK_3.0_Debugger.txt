TDK 3.0 Debugger [prio 2]
=========================

[OK]	Added ability to handle connections to more than one backend
	(nub). This can be used to debug multiple processes, provided
	the additional processes are [spawn]ed from the main debugged
	application. 'spawn' is a tcl procedure for exec'ing tcl
	scripts using the same interpreter it is run on.

	Have to distribute definition of proc [spawn].  Have to
	distribute 'spawn.pdx' to extend nub with ability to handle
	spawn.

=========================

-       Port multiplexer ?

-       Handle the debugging of concurrently running scripts.

        [[ We need more information from Cisco about the intended
           configuration ]]

	This is not specified good enough by the customer to allow the
	definition of details.

	=> See mail exchange.
