TDK 3.0 / Kit Viewer
====================

        New Tool. Specialized File Explorer for browsing through
        Metakit/Zip based virtual file systems.

Status
------
	New name:	Virtual Filesystem Explorer
	Command:	vfse
	Based on:	TkTreeCtrl for display of filetree.

Abilities
---------

[OK]	Mount zip files, starkit's, starpacks for exploration.
	(Command line and UI).

[OK]	Mount system volumes (Win: Drives, Unix: /) for exploration.

[OK]	Mount zip/metakit files in place (IOW: Pseudo-conversion of
	the file into directory and then simply browsing deeper into
	the tree.

[OK]	Opening of files with platform specific viewer (Win: Registry,
	file assocation; Unix: Just env(EDITOR)).

[OK]	Copying of files out of mounted archives to anywhere in the
	native filesystem.

[OK]	Display of type infomration, property information for selected
	files and directories.


Possible abilities
------------------

[  ]	 Introspection on tclvfs : Mount any type of filesystem
	 supported by tclvfs.

[  ]	 May need plugin system for better selection of viewer on
	 unix. Based on file type information, MIME-types + associated
	 viewers ...

[  ]	 Writing a file into a mounted non-native filesystem, if the
	 filesystem supports the operation => Editing of deployed
	 starkits and packs.


Miscellanea
-----------

Internal organization of the code is a bit dismal, especially when it
comes to menus, toolbar, handling of selection and actions. Should
create some more object classes. Another point is that the combination
of left and right pane should be placed into a larger 'explorer'
widget. Currently this is the main appl. UI with windows strewn over
the place.

Note: Creation of file-explorer widget allows for use in other
applications. TclApp/TAPE file selection panels could use
this. Virtual filesystem would actually manage 'links' to the original
places (part of file attributes).
