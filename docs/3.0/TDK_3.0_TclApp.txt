TDK 3.0 TclApp / TAPE
=====================

        Extend to allow the conversion of starkits into starpacks.

[OK]	For command line mode only.

	tclapp -genpak \
	       basekit \	(Like -prefix in regular use)
	       starkit \	(The starkit to convert)
	       result  \	(Like -output)
	       ...		(Additional regular options)

=====================

Internal use:

	The AS Build system for TDK creates both starkit and -pack for
	procheck, on windows. This extension makes this operation
	easier to code (less replication).

GUI
---

This action does not really fit into the current graphical interface.

Force fit:
	When selecting a kit as the file to wrap, mount and use the
	contents instead of the file itself.

	Usage of a standard prefix when performs the merge we want.

Problem:
	When we want to wrap the file as a file, and not as its
	contents. Example: Generation of the distribution, an
	executable containing starkits and -packs, as they are,
	and not their contents !

Need a better solution.


Command line
-------------

This can be handled easily via an additional special mode, like
'-scan' is.

	tclapp -kittopack basefile kitfile resultfile
