Xref
	  -- Display of callgraph (tree)
	  -- Test suite required for procheck xref data
	  -- Incremental recomputation of database contents, merging

Debugging
	  -- Port multiplexing				Only in /Komodo/
OK	  -- Coverage 2 profiler
OK	     -- Collect timing information

Checker
	  -- Rethink usage of checker packages
OK	     => Decouple loading and usage
OK	     -- Loading immediately and after scan
NO [x]	     -- Usage only in files which declare, and only after that
NO [x]		declaration (Scopes)

OK	  -- New mode: Package listing
OK	     -- Implies -onepass, lists all packages used.
OK	     -- Package data of this mode also in Xref
OK	     -- PD (s.a.) also above in handling of checker packages.

	  -- New scan mode (implied -onepass) to generate checker
             rules for proc's.

OK (3)	  -- Public rules API
OK	     More work on that. Has already started. Something simple
OK	     over the data structures used now.
