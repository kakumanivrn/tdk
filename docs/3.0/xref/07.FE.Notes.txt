oomk concept: virtual views for selection (row filtering) and sorting

personal concept: virtual views to transduce values like 'id's into
readable strings, f.e. the name of the object an id refers to. Also
virtual views to declare which of the columns are actually visible (to
the mktable = displayed) - projection (column filtering).


oomk / personal interaction: Cannot mix personal views and oomk views
in a sequence of views. oomk has to come first, below, and personal
modifications have to come later. reason: personal views do not have
the machinery to link correctly into metakit for operation ...

conclusion: sorting on data computed by transduce (f.e. id -> string
name) is not possible, would require the sorting view on top of a
personmal one, not possible, s.a.


workaround: we have to extend the actual view with columns containing
all the computed information we need. have to precompute the contents
after loading the database, and before opening windows. This means
that transducers are not required anymore. The only thing we need is
column filtering, and that can be done after sorting and row
filtering.

			    V----------\
	view ----> controller		"ttable mktable"
			     \----------^

			: sorting, filtering
			: table is given a different view ...


The precompuation takes extremely long ... Loading of the data for
procheck is fast, the precopute phase is then 55 seconds. That is much
to slow for a good user experience ...

Alternative ? ... The 'mktable' has to establish a cursor for reading
the data ... currently internal ... If we controller is able to get
this cursor it can set traces which compute the data ... Ahhh, this
still prevents sorting by the precomputed data ...

Alternative ... Perform the precompute as part of the phase generating
the database ... The db is larger, the loading is faster ... Or allow
the system to save the extended database ...




Classes and widgets ...
================================

stable	"Structured Table"
--------------------------

	-	Knows columns (by name)
	-	Knows columns by type (value mapper objects)
	-	Knows columns by title (string mapper objects)
	-	Has data view - Has to match column list
		(May have more columns)

	Change of the data view causes refresh of display
	*	This handles filtering and sorting.

	Data mapper default   -> self = identity
	String mapper default -> self = identity / local map

	Data mapper specification:
	     Type code for a factory ?

	     Factory has class + arguments for construction

	Subviews - View commands are present for cursor and
	during looping ... can use that to access the data
	and display something based on this ...


	map:	    column name -> id  | tktable -command
		    column id -> name  |

 - = - Better - = -

   Data mapping done in virtual views ...
   ditto hiding of columns, data based on subviews ...
   separate viewing from transformations ...




record	"Detail view"
---------------------

	- Has data view (has to match column)




ref mapping object
	- maps incoming id values to human readable string
	- able to function as delegator for data mapping in autolist.
	- delegator for data retrieval - no default - oomk view
	- is given the columns to use for the creation of the string.

filter view
	- adaptor for data view
	- delegator for data retrieval - no default - oomk view
	- is able to filter data according to specified criteria
	- changes to filter cause callout to observers ...

data view
	- adaptor for oomk view
	- extended functionality: observer mgmt
	- callout to observers on change



Factory Lists
-------------

Mapping from 'view name' to class for new list displays.
